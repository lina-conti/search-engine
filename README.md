# search-engine

This was a university project for my Object-oriented Programming course.

The goal was to implement a search engine that returns relevant documents in response to a query.
There is a boolean version, that returns all documents containing all the words in the query, 
and a vectorial version using a bag-of-words representation of documents and returning those with the best score. 
The score is calculated either using the scalar product or the cosine of the query and the document.

Instructions for this lab can be found [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/search-engine/blob/master/instructions_java_project.pdf) and my final report [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/search-engine/blob/master/report_java.pdf).

I submitted this project in December 2019.
